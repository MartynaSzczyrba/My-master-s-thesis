Analysis of the impact of using of individual stages in the microarray data analysis schemes on their classification quality

The aim of this work was to analyze the impact of using of individual stages in the microarray data analysis schemes on their classification quality, 
summarize the obtained results and indicate the approach characterized by the highest sensitivity value. For the purpose of the work the six data sets, 
differing in the stage of batch effect correction, filtration and statistical analysis, were generated. In the next step, the classification was carried out.
Finally, the sensitivity for each set was calculated.
